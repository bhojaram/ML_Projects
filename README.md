# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification(Accuracy Score: 0.99553)
This repository contains the code and documentation for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with an accuracy of 99.55%.
# Model Architecture
The model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) built using Keras. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. Here is a summary of the architecture:

1. Input: 28x28x1 grayscale image
2. Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
3. Batch normalization layers
4. Dropout layers for regularization
5. Fully connected layer with softmax activation for classification
